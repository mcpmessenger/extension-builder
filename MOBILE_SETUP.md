# Mobile Development Setup Guide

## üöÄ Quick Start for Mobile Testing

### 1. Get Your Local IP Address
```bash
npm run get-ip
```

This will show you your local IP address that mobile devices can use to access your app.

### 2. Start the Mobile-Friendly Dev Server
```bash
npm run dev:mobile
```

This starts the Next.js server on `0.0.0.0:3000`, making it accessible from mobile devices on your network.

### 3. Access on Mobile
Open your mobile browser and navigate to:
```
http://[YOUR_IP]:3000
```

Replace `[YOUR_IP]` with the IP address from step 1.

## üì± What's Fixed for Mobile

### Network Access
- ‚úÖ Server now binds to `0.0.0.0` instead of `localhost`
- ‚úÖ CORS headers added to all API routes
- ‚úÖ Dynamic host detection replaces hardcoded localhost URLs

### Mobile Responsiveness
- ‚úÖ Viewport meta tag added for proper mobile scaling
- ‚úÖ Touch-friendly button sizes (min 44px)
- ‚úÖ Prevented horizontal scroll
- ‚úÖ Improved text readability
- ‚úÖ Better modal/dialog sizing on mobile

### API Compatibility
- ‚úÖ OPTIONS method handlers for CORS preflight
- ‚úÖ All API responses include CORS headers
- ‚úÖ Dynamic base URL detection for mobile browsers

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "Failed to fetch" Errors
If you see "Failed to fetch" errors on mobile:

1. **Check Network Connection**: Ensure your mobile device and computer are on the same WiFi network
2. **Firewall Settings**: Make sure Windows Firewall allows Node.js through on port 3000
3. **Use Correct IP**: Double-check you're using the IP address from `npm run get-ip`

### API Not Working
If API calls fail on mobile:

1. **Check CORS**: The API routes now include CORS headers
2. **Use HTTPS**: Some mobile browsers require HTTPS for certain features
3. **Check Console**: Open mobile browser dev tools to see specific error messages

### Performance Issues
For better mobile performance:

1. **Use `npm run dev:mobile`**: This optimizes the dev server for mobile access
2. **Close Other Apps**: Free up memory on your mobile device
3. **Use Chrome**: Chrome mobile typically has better dev tools support

## üåê Network Requirements

- **Same WiFi Network**: Your computer and mobile device must be on the same network
- **Port 3000 Open**: Ensure your router/firewall allows connections on port 3000
- **Static IP (Optional)**: For consistent access, consider setting a static IP for your development machine

## üìã Development Commands

```bash
# Get your local IP address
npm run get-ip

# Start mobile-friendly dev server
npm run dev:mobile

# Regular dev server (localhost only)
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server (mobile accessible)
npm start
```

## üîç Testing Checklist

- [ ] App loads on mobile browser
- [ ] API calls work without CORS errors
- [ ] Touch interactions work properly
- [ ] No horizontal scrolling
- [ ] Text is readable
- [ ] Buttons are touch-friendly
- [ ] Modals/dialogs fit screen properly

## üö® Security Note

The CORS headers are set to `*` for development only. For production, you should restrict this to your specific domain.
