# Product Requirements Document: Playwright Clickable Link Screenshot App

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This document outlines the requirements for a web application designed to automate the process of capturing screenshots of every clickable link on a given website. The primary goal is to provide a comprehensive visual audit of a website's interactive elements, including their appearance in both light and dark mode.

### 1.2 Scope

The application will utilize Playwright to navigate a specified URL, identify all clickable elements, interact with them (e.g., click), and capture a screenshot of the resulting page state. It will support configuration for dark mode simulation and output organized screenshots for review.

### 1.3 Goals

*   **Automate Visual Regression Testing**: Enable developers and QA teams to quickly identify visual discrepancies or unexpected changes after interacting with clickable elements.
*   **Enhance Accessibility**: Provide visual feedback on how interactive elements behave and appear, especially in different display modes.
*   **Streamline QA Processes**: Reduce manual effort required for visual verification of website functionality.

## 2. User Stories

*   As a **QA Engineer**, I want to input a website URL so that I can automatically get screenshots of all clickable links.
*   As a **Developer**, I want to specify dark mode for screenshot capture so that I can verify the website's appearance in different themes.
*   As a **Designer**, I want organized output of screenshots so that I can easily review the visual state of interactive elements.
*   As a **Project Manager**, I want a clear report of the captured screenshots so that I can track the visual quality of the website.

## 3. Features

### 3.1 Core Functionality

*   **URL Input**: Allow users to specify the target website URL.
*   **Clickable Element Identification**: Automatically detect all `<a>`, `<button>`, and other interactive elements (e.g., elements with `onclick` attributes or specific CSS classes indicating clickability).
*   **Element Interaction**: Programmatically click each identified clickable element.
*   **Screenshot Capture**: Capture a full-page screenshot after each click action.
*   **Dark Mode Support**: Option to simulate dark mode for screenshot capture.
*   **Output Management**: Organize and save screenshots with clear naming conventions (e.g., `link_name_light_mode.png`, `link_name_dark_mode.png`).

### 3.2 Configuration Options

*   **Browser Selection**: Option to choose between Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit.
*   **Viewport Size**: Configure the browser viewport dimensions.
*   **Concurrency**: Set the number of parallel browser instances for faster processing.
*   **Delay**: Introduce a delay before taking a screenshot after a click to allow page elements to load.

## 4. Technical Requirements

### 4.1 Technology Stack

*   **Core Automation**: Playwright (Node.js/Python library).
*   **User Interface**: (To be determined, e.g., a simple web interface using Flask/React or a command-line interface).

### 4.2 Playwright Specifics

*   **Element Locators**: Utilize Playwright's robust locator strategies to identify clickable elements reliably [1].
*   **Click Action**: Employ `page.click()` or `locator.click()` for interacting with elements [2].
*   **Screenshot API**: Use `page.screenshot()` with options like `fullPage: true` and `path` for saving screenshots [3].
*   **Dark Mode Simulation**: Leverage Playwright's `colorScheme: 'dark'` option in `browser.newContext()` or `page.emulateMedia()` to simulate dark mode [4].

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

### 5.1 Performance

*   The application should efficiently process websites with a large number of links.
*   Screenshot capture should be optimized to minimize execution time.

### 5.2 Usability

*   The interface (CLI or GUI) should be intuitive and easy to use.
*   Output screenshots should be clearly labeled and organized.

### 5.3 Reliability

*   The application should handle various website structures and dynamic content gracefully.
*   Error handling should be robust, providing informative messages for failed operations.

## 6. Future Considerations

*   **Visual Comparison**: Integrate a visual regression testing tool to automatically compare screenshots against a baseline.
*   **Report Generation**: Generate detailed reports including a summary of links, success/failure rates, and direct links to screenshots.
*   **Authentication Support**: Ability to handle websites requiring user login.
*   **Advanced Interaction**: Support for hover states, form submissions, and other complex user interactions.
