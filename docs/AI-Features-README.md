### Analysis Data Structure
Each analysis file contains:
```json
{
  "page_type": "landing|form|navigation|content|error|success",
  "primary_action": "description of main call-to-action",
  "interactive_elements": [
    {
      "element_type": "button|link|form|input|dropdown|checkbox",
      "description": "brief description",
      "purpose": "likely user intent",
      "priority": "high|medium|low",
      "location": "header|main|sidebar|footer"
    }
  ],
