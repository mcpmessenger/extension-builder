# Technical Product Requirements Document: Browser Extension Builder App

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** September 30, 2025
**Author:** Manus AI

## 1. Introduction

This Technical Product Requirements Document (PRD) details the requirements for a browser extension builder application. The primary objective is to enable administrators to create interactive, guided workflow extensions for end-users. These extensions will facilitate navigation and task completion within specific websites by providing step-by-step visual and textual guidance. The application will focus on capturing user interactions, generating visual aids (screenshots and GIFs), and packaging these into deployable Chrome extensions.

## 2. Goals and Objectives

*   **Empower Administrators:** Provide a user-friendly platform for administrators to easily create and manage browser extensions without requiring coding knowledge.
*   **Enhance End-User Experience:** Deliver clear, intuitive, and interactive workflow guidance to end-users directly within their browsing experience.
*   **Streamline Workflow Capture:** Offer robust tools for capturing web page states and user interactions, including screenshots and animated GIFs.
*   **Flexible Deployment:** Support both local 

loading (unpacked) and official Chrome Web Store distribution.
*   **Modern UI/UX:** Provide a visually appealing and intuitive interface for the admin application, including dark mode support.

## 3. Scope

This PRD covers the development of a web-based application for administrators to build Chrome extensions that guide end-users through website workflows. It includes features for workflow definition, media capture (screenshots, GIFs), annotation, extension configuration, and packaging. The initial focus is on Chrome extensions, with potential for expansion to other browsers in the future.

## 4. User Roles and Stories

### 4.1. User Roles

*   **Admin (Extension Creator):** The primary user of the web application. Responsible for creating, editing, and managing workflow extensions.
*   **End Website User (Extension Consumer):** The user who installs and utilizes the generated Chrome extension to navigate specific website workflows. They do not interact with the extension builder application.

### 4.2. User Stories

**As an Admin, I want to...**

*   ...easily create a new extension project so I can start defining a workflow.
*   ...browse a website within the app so I can capture workflow steps directly.
*   ...capture a full-page screenshot or a cropped area of a webpage so I can use it as a visual aid for a workflow step.
*   ...record a short GIF of an interaction (e.g., before and after a click) so end-users can intuitively understand the action.
*   ...add text annotations, arrows, and highlights to captured media so I can provide clear instructions.
*   ...define a sequence of steps for a workflow (1-3 workflows, up to 10 steps each) so end-users are guided systematically.
*   ...specify the type of interaction for each step (e.g., click, type, select) so the extension can guide the user accurately.
*   ...configure the extension's metadata (name, description, icon) so it is properly identified.
*   ...package the extension for local loading (unpacked) so I can test it during development.
*   ...package the extension for submission to the Chrome Web Store so end-users can easily install it.
*   ...have a modern GUI with thin lines and text, and dark mode, so the app is visually appealing and comfortable to use.

**As an End Website User, I want to...**

*   ...install a Chrome extension that guides me through specific workflows on a website.
*   ...see clear visual cues (screenshots, GIFs) and instructions for each step of a workflow.
*   ...be shown exactly where to click or what to input on a webpage.
*   ...easily navigate between workflow steps.

## 7. Technical Specifications

### 7.1. Admin Web Application Technologies

*   **Frontend Framework:** React.js (or similar modern JavaScript framework).
*   **UI/UX Design:** Custom CSS with a focus on thin lines, minimalist typography (Montserrat Thin), and a dark mode theme. Potential use of a UI library like Tailwind CSS for rapid styling.
*   **Browser Automation/Capture:** Integration with browser APIs (e.g., `chrome.tabCapture`, `chrome.desktopCapture`) for in-browser capture. For advanced scenarios or a more controlled environment, a headless browser automation library (e.g., Puppeteer, Playwright) might be considered for the Admin App's integrated browser view.
*   **GIF Encoding:** Client-side JavaScript libraries such as `gifshot`, `gif.js`, `gifenc`, or `MediaStream-GifRecorder` for converting recorded video segments into animated GIFs. This processing will be offloaded to Web Workers to maintain UI responsiveness.

### 7.2. Generated Chrome Extension Technologies

*   **Manifest Version:** Chrome Extension Manifest V3.
*   **Core Languages:** JavaScript, HTML, CSS.
*   **Scripts:** Background scripts for managing extension state and communication, content scripts for DOM interaction and injecting UI elements into target web pages.
*   **Element Identification:** Content scripts will use robust CSS selectors, XPath, or a combination of strategies to reliably locate target elements on the webpage.
*   **Interaction Simulation:** Programmatic simulation of user events (e.g., `click()`, `dispatchEvent(new Event('input'))`, `selectedIndex` manipulation).
*   **Visual Overlays:** Dynamic injection of HTML/CSS elements into the webpage by content scripts to provide highlights, text annotations, and navigational cues.

### 7.3. Data Storage and Persistence

*   **Admin App Project Data:** For initial stages, project data (workflow definitions, captured media references, extension configurations) can be stored client-side using IndexedDB or Local Storage. For future scalability, multi-admin support, and robust backup, a dedicated backend with a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) and cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage) would be required.
*   **Extension Data:** Workflow definitions, instructions, and embedded media (screenshots, GIFs) will be bundled directly within the generated extension package. For very large media assets, a Content Delivery Network (CDN) could be used, with the extension fetching assets on demand.

## 8. Logic Gaps and Future Considerations

*   **Backend Implementation:** The decision on whether to implement a backend for the Admin Web Application is crucial. A backend would enable user authentication, multi-admin collaboration, centralized project storage, and analytics, but adds significant complexity. For an MVP, client-side storage might suffice.
*   **Robust Element Identification:** Websites are dynamic. Strategies to handle changes in a website's DOM structure (e.g., dynamic IDs, class name changes) are vital for the longevity of generated extensions. This could involve AI-driven element identification, multiple fallback selectors, or a mechanism for admins to easily update selectors.
*   **Advanced Interaction Support:** Initial focus will be on common interactions (clicks, text input, dropdowns). Future iterations could explore support for drag-and-drop, canvas interactions, and interactions within iframes.
*   **Localization:** The ability to create workflows with instructions in multiple languages would enhance the global usability of the generated extensions.
*   **Performance Optimization for Extensions:** Strategies for minimizing the size of bundled media (e.g., image compression, GIF optimization) and optimizing content script execution to ensure the generated extensions do not degrade end-user browsing performance.
*   **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** While the initial focus is on Chrome, future development could extend support to other browsers (e.g., Firefox, Edge) by adapting to their respective extension APIs.
